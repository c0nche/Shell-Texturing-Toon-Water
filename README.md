My small purely learning project for Unity, i made inspired by [Acerola video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dr-tRQzij4&t=1109s)

In ovarall logic of building shells it's same as [Acerola's shell texturing implimentation](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Shell-Texturing). Though mine is simplier because i dont have lighting and movement phisics **(⌒_⌒;)**. I might add lighting whenever I have time and will, but for now it will stay as it is for indefinite term.

[The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com), especially [this chapter](https://thebookofshaders.com/12/), helped me made *toon water shader*. The logic behind voronoi is heavily based of this chapter, but it's still pretty different, because of my attemts to achieve pixilated effect. I'm not very happy with it, but i don't believe it can look better and it's *not bad* enough, so i don't think i'll change it. Water with big amount of pixels came out pretty good though **(^ω^)**

If you want to see how much autist am i *(be aware that this is not normal first of all)*, i commented all code and tried to clear it as much as possible, so it's not complete legacy mess and more than readable
